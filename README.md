# stock-trend-identification-with-adaptive-neuro-fuzzy-inference-system
It is not possible to predict stock price. But with technical analysis, identifying an uptrend or a downtrend is possible. 
Various indicators are supposed to show similar combinations during a uptrend in share price. Finding these combinations manually require years of experience with trial and error. This project uses ANFIS to find the characteristics of various indicators during an uptrend.
The indicators used are-
1. RSI
2. MACD
3. EMA
4. SMA
5. Volume ratio
